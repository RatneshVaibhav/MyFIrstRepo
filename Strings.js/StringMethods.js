/* strings in JS are immutable- means that any method used on the string does'nt alters the original string but rather it creates a new string 

1) slice- its like substring method in java. str.slice(a,b) where ath index included but bth index is not included
we can also use it like str.slice(a), it will give the substring from ath index till last character of string

2) str.toUpperCase() and str.toLowerCase()

3) str.trim()- to remove spaces present before the 1st character of string and present after the last character of the string

4) str.replace('love','do') or str.replace('o','p')- to replace a substring with another substring or a character with another character

5) str.repeate(n)- str will be repeated n times and will be printed without giving spaces
